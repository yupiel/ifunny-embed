# iFunny Embed
Similar to projects like vxtwitter.
iFunny links sadly don't embed in discord so I wrote this (and am running it on my own server) to send iFunny links to people.

Take for example the link https://ifunny.co/picture/camp-aga-dad-camprigh-3pECLibx9 and replace the `ifunny.co` part with `ifunny.yupiel.net` (or wherever you host it).
This will make pictures embed into discord seamlessly. For videos you will still be able to see the link above them, however, the video will be visible.

Use it via my website ifunny.yupiel.net or host it yourself.

## Disclaimer

I'm not affiliated with iFunny and I also won't guarantee the link via my website to work at all.

Yes, you can probably write this in a more performan way but i'm lazy.
